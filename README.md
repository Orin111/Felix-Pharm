# Felix Pharm

**AI-driven water optimization system for agriculture using sensor data and machine learning.**

## 📌 Description
Felix Pharm is an **AI-powered** solution that helps farmers reduce water consumption by up to **45%** by analyzing real-time soil data and weather conditions. The system uses **SICK sensors** to collect moisture, temperature, and pH levels, which are processed by a machine learning model to recommend optimal irrigation levels.

## 🛠 Installation
To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To start the system:
```bash
python main.py
```
